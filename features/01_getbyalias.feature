Feature: Get by alias

  Background: dataClay deployment
    Given "UserA" has a configuration file "resources/common/cfgfiles/client.properties" to be used to connect to dataClay
      And "UserA" has a session file "resources/common/cfgfiles/session.properties" to be used in test application
      And "UserA" deploys dataClay with docker-compose.yml file "resources/get-by-alias/docker-compose.yml"
      And "UserA" waits until dataClay has 1 backends of "java" language
      And "UserA" waits until dataClay has 1 backends of "python" language
      And "UserA" creates an account named "UserA" with password "UserA"
      And "UserA" creates a dataset named "datasetA"
      And "UserA" creates a namespace named "test_namespace"
      And "UserA" creates a datacontract allowing access to dataset "datasetA" to user "UserA"
      And "UserA" registers a model located at "resources/common/model" into namespace "test_namespace"
      And "UserA" get stubs from namespace "test_namespace" into "stubs" directory

  Scenario: run simple get by alias
    Given "UserA" starts a new session
      And "UserA" runs make persistent for an object with alias "myobj"
     Then "UserA" gets the object with alias "myobj"
      And "UserA" finishes the session
